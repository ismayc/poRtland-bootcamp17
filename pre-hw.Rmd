Use the computational tools/statistical analysis workflow you are familiar with to perform the following tasks:

The `nyc-weather-13.csv` file available from <http://bit.ly/nyc-weather-13> contains hourly meteorological data from 2013 for each of the three New York City airports:

  - `EWR` - Newark Liberty International Airport
  - `JFK` - John F. Kennedy International Airport
  - `LGA` - LaGuardia Airport
  
1. Produce a plot exploring the relationship between `month` and `temp`.
1. Calculate the minimum temperature recorded for each month across all three airports. 
    - This should result in a dataset with 12 rows and two columns.
1. Produce a plot showing how minimum temperature varies across the 12 months.
1. Calculate the minimum temperature recorded for each month FOR EACH OF the three airports. 
    - This should result in a dataset with 36 rows and three columns.
1. Explore the multivariate relationship between month, airport, and minimum temperature via a statistical graphic.

**Last but not least**:  Produce a report providing the calculations done in table form as well as the graphics made.  Also include a brief discussion about what stands out from the plots and calculations after each of the five tasks above.
