# Pre-bootcamp HW

## Talk about your analysis on the <br> `weather` data <br> in groups of 2-3

---

# Let's get it all out there

## When you think of R what comes to mind?

---

name: whyr

## Why are you here wanting to learn R?

- ~~Because you enjoy partaking in [Schadenfreude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude)~~

---

## Why should you learn R?

- R is free, R improves, R has existed for 40+ years
- Students can show what they have learned to a potential employer easily
- The support system for R is actually much better than some people say


---

## But as a professor, why should you learn R?

- R and R Markdown will save you TONS of time. Long term thinking is key.
    - You can easily tweak your code if you need to do another analysis
    - Remembering what drop-down menu some thing is in two years from now in a different program will be hard
    - Remembering to copy-and-paste your updated plots/analysis into your word processor is a pain and error prone

## What this bootcamp is

![](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/img/tidyverse.png)

- Designed for all levels of knowledge and background

---

## What this bootcamp is not

- A thorough development of machine learning <br> techniques applied to big data

--

- A discussion on the role of _p_-values in science

--

- A tutorial on how to work with base R subsetting and base R graphics 

---

## What I hope you'll learn

- That R is not as scary as it used to be.  

--

- Learning how to Google is an incredibly valuable skill.

--

- That having students turn in assignments using R scripts and R Markdown provides an efficient way to check their work and their analyses easily.

---

## What I hope you'll learn

- That the R packages you will use in this workshop are the same ones that are used by scientists and graduate programs all over the world

--

- That teaching students how to use open-source tools is what is best for them long term

--

- That students with no programming background can do great things in only a few weeks
    - [Sociology/Criminal Justice majors at Pacific U.](https://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/group-projects/index.html)

## Pieces of advice

<center>
<a href="http://giphy.com/gifs/pool-diving-synchronized-swimming-pDWtwK7D2IlFu"><img src="figure/giphy2.gif" style="width: 300px;"/></a>
</center>

- Scaffold & support as a foreign languages do

--

- To be able to use R (and really any other language), students need more than a few assignments and more than a weekly lab

--

- Make use of RStudio Projects (students have a really hard time navigating directory structures)


---

## Pieces of advice

### My opinion

- Have students work on writing their code in R script files and documenting their errors
    - This is the same workflow that DataCamp uses

--

- Show students [R Markdown after a few weeks](https://ismayc.github.io/soc301_s2017/schedule/) of working with the script file
    - I've found it is hard for students to learn R and R Markdown from the start
    - Better to have them use R Markdown in groups initially

# R Data Types

---

## The bare minimum needed for understanding today

Vector/variable
  - Type of vector (`int`, `num`, `chr`, `lgl`, `date`)

--

Data frame
  - Vectors of (potentially) different types
  - Each vector has the same number of rows

---

## The bare minimum needed for understanding today

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(lubridate)
ex1 <- data_frame(
    vec1 = c(1980, 1990, 2000, 2010),
    vec2 = c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L),
    vec3 = c("low", "low", "high", "high"),
    vec4 = c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE),
    vec5 = ymd(c("2017-05-23", "1776/07/04", "1983-05/31", "1908/04-01"))

# Welcome to the [tidyverse](https://blog.rstudio.org/2016/09/15/tidyverse-1-0-0/)!

## Beginning steps

Frequently the first thing to do when given a dataset is to
- identify the observational unit,
- specify the variables,
- give the types of variables you are presented with, and
- check that the data is <u>tidy</u>. (TO COME)

This will help with 
- choosing the appropriate plot, 
- summarizing the data, and 
- understanding which inferences/models can be applied.

#gap_with_colors <-
#  data.frame(gapminder,
#             cc = I(country_colors[match(gapminder$country,
#                                         names(country_colors))]))

gapminder %>% filter(year == 1992) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = log(gdpPercap, base = 10), y = lifeExp, color = continent,
             size = pop)) +
  geom_point() + xlab('Gross Domestic Product (log scale)') + ylab('Life Expectancy at birth (years)') + ggtitle("Gapminder for 1992")

#+
#  scale_color_manual(values = gapminder::continent_colors)
```


- What are the variables here?
- What is the observational unit?
- How are the variables mapped to aesthetics?

  data_frame(
    A = c(1980, 1990, 2000, 2010),
    B = c(1, 2, 3, 4),
    C = c(3, 2, 1, 2),
    D = c("low", "low", "high", "high")
  )
simple_ex
```

# The Five-Named Graphs 

## The 5NG of data viz

- Scatterplot: `geom_point()`
- Line graph: `geom_line()`
--

- Histogram: `geom_histogram()`
- Boxplot: `geom_boxplot()`
- Bar graph: `geom_bar()`


---

class: center, middle

## More `ggplot2` examples

---

## Histogram

```{r fig.height=5.5}
library(nycflights13)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = humid)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, color = "black", fill = "darkorange")
```

---

## Boxplot (broken)

```{r fig.height=5.5}
library(nycflights13)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, y = humid)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

---


## Boxplot (almost fixed)

```{r fig.height=5.5}
library(nycflights13)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, group = month, y = humid)) +
  geom_boxplot() 
```
---

# Boxplot (fixed)

```{r fig.height=5.5}
library(nycflights13)
ggplot(data = weather, mapping = aes(x = month, group = month, y = humid)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:12)
```

---

## Bar graph

```{r}
library(fivethirtyeight)
ggplot(data = bechdel, mapping = aes(x = clean_test)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

## How about over time?

- Hop into `dplyr`

```{r}
library(dplyr)
year_bins <- c("'70-'74", "'75-'79", "'80-'84", "'85-'89",
               "'90-'94", "'95-'99", "'00-'04", "'05-'09",
               "'10-'13")
bechdel <- bechdel %>%
  mutate(five_year = cut(year, 
                         breaks = seq(1969, 2014, 5), 
                         labels = year_bins)) %>% 
  mutate(clean_test = factor(clean_test, 
                             levels = c("nowomen", "notalk", "men",
                                        "dubious", "ok")))
```

---

## How about over time? (Stacked)

```{r fig.width=11}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = bechdel,
       mapping = aes(x = five_year, fill = clean_test)) +
  geom_bar()
```

---

## How about over time? (Side-by-side)

```{r fig.width=11}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = bechdel,
       mapping = aes(x = five_year, fill = clean_test)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge")
```

---

## How about over time? (Stacked proportional)

```{r fig.width=11}
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = bechdel,
       mapping = aes(x = five_year, fill = clean_test)) +
  geom_bar(position = "fill", color = "black")
```

## Practice

Produce appropriate 5NG with R package & data set in [ ], e.g., [`nycflights13` $\rightarrow$ `weather`] 

<!--
Try to look through the help documentation/Google to improve your plots
-->

1. Does `age` predict `recline_rude`? <br> [`fivethirtyeight` $\rightarrow$ `na.omit(flying)`]

2. Distribution of `age` by `sex` <br> [`okcupiddata` $\rightarrow$ `profiles`]

3. Does `budget` predict `rating`? <br> [`ggplot2movies` $\rightarrow$ `movies`]

4. Distribution of log base 10 scale of `budget_2013` <br> [`fivethirtyeight` $\rightarrow$ `bechdel`]

---

### HINTS

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=7, fig.width=10.5}
library(gridExtra)
library(fivethirtyeight)
library(ggplot2movies)
library(okcupiddata)

p1 <- ggplot(data = na.omit(flying), mapping = aes(fill = recline_rude, x = age)) + geom_bar(position = "fill") + ggtitle("Problem 1") + theme_gray(base_size = 20)

p2 <- ggplot(data = profiles, mapping = aes(x = sex, y = age)) +
  geom_boxplot() + ggtitle("Problem 2") + theme_gray(base_size = 20)

p3 <- ggplot(data = movies, mapping = aes(x = budget, y = rating)) +
  geom_point() + ggtitle("Problem 3") + theme_gray(base_size = 20)

p4 <- ggplot(data = bechdel, mapping = aes(x = log(budget_2013, 10))) +
  geom_histogram(color = "white", bins = 10) + ggtitle("Problem 4") +
  theme_gray(base_size = 20)

grid.arrange(p1, p2, p3, p4, ncol = 2, padding = unit(0.5, "line"),
             widths = c(2.6, 1.4))

```

# Data Wrangling

---

### `gapminder` data frame in the `gapminder` package

```{r rows.print=15}
library(gapminder)
gapminder
```

---

## Base R versus the `tidyverse`

Say we wanted mean life expectancy across all years for Asia
--

```{r}
# Base R
asia <- gapminder[gapminder$continent == "Asia", ]
mean(asia$lifeExp)
```
--
 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
gapminder %>% filter(continent == "Asia") %>%
  summarize(mean_exp = mean(lifeExp))
```

---

## The pipe `%>%`

`r knitr::include_graphics("figure/pipe.png")` &emsp; &emsp;`r knitr::include_graphics("figure/MagrittePipe.jpg")`
--

- A way to chain together commands
--

- It is *essentially* the `dplyr` equivalent to the <br> `+` in `ggplot2`

## The 5NG of data viz
--

### `geom_point()`<br> `geom_line()` <br> `geom_histogram()`<br>  `geom_boxplot()`<br> `geom_bar()`

---

# The Five Main Verbs (5MV) of data wrangling

### `filter()` <br> `summarize()` <br> `group_by()` <br> `mutate()` <br> `arrange()`

---

## `filter()`

- Select a subset of the rows of a data frame. 

- The arguments are the "filters" that you'd like to apply.
--

```{r}
library(gapminder); library(dplyr)
gap_2007 <- gapminder %>% filter(year == 2007)
head(gap_2007)
```

- Use `==` to compare a variable to a value

---

## Logical operators

- Use `|` to check for any in multiple filters being true:
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002 | continent == "Europe")
```
--

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002 | continent == "Europe")
```

---

## Logical operators

- Use `&` or `,` to check for all of multiple filters being true:
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002, continent == "Europe")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 2002, continent == "Europe")
```

---

## Logical operators

- Use `%in%` to check for any being true <br> (shortcut to using `|` repeatedly with `==`)
--

```{r eval=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Argentina", "Belgium", "Mexico"),
         year %in% c(1987, 1992))
```
--

```{r echo=FALSE}
gapminder %>% 
  filter(country %in% c("Argentina", "Belgium", "Mexico"),
         year %in% c(1987, 1992))
```


---

## `summarize()`

- Any numerical summary that you want to apply to a column of a data frame is specified within `summarize()`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
max_exp_1997 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
max_exp_1997
```
--

```{r echo=FALSE}
max_exp_1997 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
max_exp_1997
```



---

### Combining `summarize()` with `group_by()`

When you'd like to determine a numerical summary for all
levels of a different categorical variable

```{r eval=FALSE}
max_exp_1997_by_cont <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
max_exp_1997_by_cont
```

--
```{r echo=FALSE}
max_exp_1997_by_cont <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year == 1997) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>%
  summarize(max_exp = max(lifeExp))
max_exp_1997_by_cont
```

---

## `ggplot2` revisited

For aggregated data, use `geom_col`

```{r fig.height=4.5}
ggplot(data = max_exp_1997_by_cont, 
       mapping = aes(x = continent, y = max_exp)) +
  geom_col()
```
---


## The 5MV

- `filter()`
- `summarize()`
- `group_by()`
--

- `mutate()`

--
- `arrange()`

---

## `mutate()`

- Allows you to 
    1. <font color="blue">create a new variable with a specific value</font> OR
    2. create a new variable based on other variables OR
    3. change the contents of an existing variable

--

```{r}
gap_plus <- gapminder %>% mutate(just_one = 1)
head(gap_plus)
```

---

## `mutate()`

- Allows you to 
    1. create a new variable with a specific value OR
    2. <font color="blue">create a new variable based on other variables</font> OR
    3. change the contents of an existing variable

--

```{r}
gap_w_gdp <- gapminder %>% mutate(gdp = pop * gdpPercap)
head(gap_w_gdp)
```

---

## `mutate()`

- Allows you to 
    1. create a new variable with a specific value OR
    2. create a new variable based on other variables OR
    3. <font color="blue">change the contents of an existing variable</font>

--

```{r}
gap_weird <- gapminder %>% mutate(pop = pop + 1000)
head(gap_weird)
```

---

## `arrange()`

- Reorders the rows in a data frame based on the values of one or more variables
--

```{r}
gapminder %>%
  arrange(year, country)
```

---

## `arrange()`

- Can also put into descending order
--

```{r desc, results="hide"}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year > 2000) %>%
  arrange(desc(lifeExp))
```

---

## Don't mix up `arrange` and `group_by`

- `group_by` is used (mostly) with `summarize` to calculate summaries over groups

- `arrange` is used for sorting

---

## Don't mix up `arrange` and `group_by`

This doesn't really do anything useful

```{r rows.print=10}
gapminder %>% group_by(year)
```

---

## Don't mix up `arrange` and `group_by`

But this does

```{r rows.print=10}
gapminder %>% arrange(year)
```

---

## Changing of observation unit

True or False
> Each of `filter`, `mutate`, and `arrange` change the observational unit.

### Does cost of living in a state relate to whether police officers live in the cities they patrol?  What about state political ideology?


```{r rows.print=7}
library(fivethirtyeight); library(readr)
police2 <- police_locals %>% select(city, all)
ideology <- read_csv("https://ismayc.github.io/Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/datasets/ideology.csv")
police_join <- inner_join(x = police2, y = ideology, by = "city")
police_join
```

```{r}
url <- paste0("https://ismayc.github.io/",
              "Effective-Data-Storytelling-using-the-tidyverse/",
              "datasets/cost_of_living.csv")
cost_of_living <- read_csv(url)
police_join_cost <- inner_join(
    x = police_join, 
    y = cost_of_living, 
    by = "state"
  )
police_join_cost %>% select(-state) %>% arrange(city)

## Practice <small><small>(Lay out what the resulting table should look like on paper first.)</small></small>

Use the 5MV to answer problems from R data packages, e.g., [`nycflights13` $\rightarrow$ `weather`] 

1. What is the maximum arrival delay for each carrier departing JFK? [`nycflights13` $\rightarrow$ `flights`]

2. Determine the top five movies in terms of domestic return on investment for 2013 scaled data<br> [`fivethirtyeight` $\rightarrow$ `bechdel`]

3. [Include the name of the destination airport as a column in the `flights` data frame](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png) <br> [`nycflights13` $\rightarrow$ `flights`, `airports`]

# DEMO of `dplyr` in RStudio

---

## Homework for tomorrow

- Review the Data Import cheatsheet and use the `readr`, `readxl`, and `haven` packages to read in data from CSVs, Excel XLS/XLSX files, STATA/SPSS files

- Use `ggplot2` and `dplyr` to make graphics and produce data wrangling on data sets of interest to you read in from the previous step

<br>

Before you go

- Tell me on the sheet of paper you have what types of models you usually run (i.e., linear regression, logistic regression, mixed models, etc.)
